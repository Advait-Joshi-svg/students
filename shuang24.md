Hi, I'm Sarah! I'm a 1st year PhD student taking this class to finish my degree. I do data visualization research with Dr. Jian Huang. I'm still figuring out what specifically about data visualization I like, but I like novel ways to present data and anything visual. In this class, I expect to learn about some software engineering tools or libraries that will help me with my future projects. 

The current research I'm working on is how to utilize research papers to explain web-based visualization tools. I'm not familiar with software engineering research, but I could recreate my work and instead look into software tools or repositories with supporting research papers. Besides research papers, I want to look at other sources like videos or technical manuals, which will require some analysis tools to transform the data to what I need. But in general, I'm open to projects that trace back to data visualization or LLMs (since my project uses AI too).
