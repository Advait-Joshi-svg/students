I am a masters student that primarily works on Neuromorphic computing with TENNlab. However, I'm doing that for my job and my thesis already, so I think that I'd like a change of pace in this class. 
I am open to reviews and projects that don't have a strong machine learning focus. I find basic NLP such as word2vec and similar to be very interesting and would be open to learning more about that.
