### Background
I am from Murfreesboro, Tennessee, and I am a master's candidate in computer science at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. I have work experience that includes a couple internships with Sam's Club and one internship with Trimble. In my free time, I really enjoy watching and playing sports, especially football, soccer, and table tennis.

### Interests
Regarding research, I currently work under Dr. Schuman in the TENNLab, which is focused on neuromorphic computing. This lab is a perfect fit for me since I am really interested in machine learning and neural networks. In terms of a software tool that could be developed for this class, I think it would be useful to create a tool that compared two networks and displayed every difference between the two. Things to look at could include the shape, weights, thresholds, and interactions with given a particular set of input spikes. This would really help me in my current work, as I am currently having some difficulties with scaling weights and thresholds across different networks while still getting the same results.

### What I Expect from the Class
From this class, I want to develop a meaningful project. Specifically, I really want to develop a tool that can not only help myself, but also the rest of my lab, with network comparison. Additionally, I also expect to further my teamwork and presentation skills.
