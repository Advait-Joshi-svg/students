## Who am I?
Hi everyone, I am Manan Patel. I am pursuing a Masters degree in Computer Science with Machine learning and Intelligent Systems concentration. My advisor is Dr. Catherine Schuman.

## Research Interests?

Research wise I am interested in generative AI models and combining it with my passion of software development.

## What I expect from this class?

I expect to learn more about AI integration into software and how we can benefit from it.

## What project to work on for this class?

I am open to work on any software project in this class. Specifically, I would like to apply generative models to practical applications. For example, generative models can be used to automatically respond to emails or an automation to do that so the user can reply to an email with just one click without typing anything.

## What research I want to review

I want to review AI models that are incorporated in software and what benefits/drawbacks that come with it.
