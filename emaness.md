I am a first-year graduate student pursuing an M.S. in Computer Science.
I research neuromorphic computing as a GRA in TENNLab under my advisor, Dr. Catherine Schuman.

I enjoy software engineering because I enjoy creative problem-solving.
Additionally, I find intersection of software and machine learning particularly fascinating.
While the topic of learning algorithms is no longer a new area of research, it continues to change and evolve rapidly with plenty of interesting ideas and papers to review.
A project involving some form of recommendation algorithm could be quite interesting. I would prefer to avoid using generative AI for the class project.
