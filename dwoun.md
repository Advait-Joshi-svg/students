Hello my name is Dong Jun Woun. I am interested in measuring the real-time performance of recent APU hardware that combines CPUs and GPUs. In particular, I am wishing to review memory, power, and energy performance. Previously, I have done research measuring the accuracy and time performance of machine learning models on adiabatic quantum computers(https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12485).
