I am currently a fullstack software developer while I finish up my senior year of undergrad. I'm mostly interested in video game development and I haven't really done any research in the past, but over the summer I did a lot of UI/UX work for my company and really enjoyed that. After hearing someone talk about it in class, I think I could be interested in researching something about UI/UX, but I'm not sure what specifically.
