Project idea: Looking into software testing. So the different types of areas to test, diferent tools that are avaliable, what can and can't be covered, and pros and cons of each tool and type of testing. May want this to be more specific to something like web development where front end and back end stuff are looked at. This should would be more focused while still allowing a nice about of options to be looked at. These are just some of my intitial ideas so I's sure there could be mre things to look at for this.
