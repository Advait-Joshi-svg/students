I am an undergraduate Computer Science student pursuing a B.S. with a minor in Business Administration.
My research interests are focused on human-computer interaction and programming languages. Particularly I'd like
to look into what makes software intuitive, or I'd like to compare programming languages in various contexts.
I expect this class to make me more confident as a Software Engineer.
