## Who am I?

I am an undergrad student here at UTK, in my final semester for a Bachelor's in Computer Science. I am the secretary of DriveUT, the automotive enthusiast club on campus, and my hobbies include automobiles and automobile photography, video games, and table-top RPGs like Dungeons & Dragons.

In terms of software engineering, I enjoy researching full-stack web and app development. I'm a big fan of UX/UI design and developing more user-friendly features in software projects, but I've also dipped my toes into backend connection and SQL databases.

## What are my expectations?

The research I am interested in is full-stack development. There are many ways that software can be developed, and I think that exploring all of the different options for basing that software would be interesting.

My friends and I have discussed a potential project that would include explaining the algorithms used by large social media companies (Meta, TikTok, X, etc.) and developing our own algorithm and/or app where we could simulate and visualize how user engagement directly influences the user experience. It could also open up the possibility of researching how development teams can influence the algorithm on a wide-scale to skew the user experience without user interaction. It's quite a hot topic at the moment, and I think this class would be a great opportunity to be able to research it and share the results.
