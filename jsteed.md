I'm a masters student taking this class as a requirement for graduation. My research area is neuromorphic computing and machine learning. I would like to work on a tool to compare performance of neural networks generated from our software framework. I would like to make a tool that would be useful for comparing different characteristics of neural networks, such as their size, synapse weights, or activity levels.
