I'm Tyler, I'm a first year PhD student with Dr. Schuman, I'm broadly interested in machine learning and more narrowly on neuromorphic.
Neuromorphic is somewhat niche so I'm not expecting to be able to do something along those lines in this course but as long as I'm doing
somehthing machine-learning-y I'm content.
