I am a 2nd year PhD student with a focus in software systems. I primarily have worked with the JVM Memory Management system, but I have also done some kernel work and have worked with NUMA systems.

I would like to review and work on software engineering problems in systems programming. There are numerous intriguing works, particularly in the development of low-overhead profiling systems that can be effectively utilized.
I do understand that this line of work may not be really conducive to a team project, and I am very open to working on something else.
