I am a student completing the 5 year master's. My research experience involves machine learning applications mainly in the
cybersecurity domain and more recently in the healthcare field. Regarding specific ideas for a software engineering project
related to my experience, I am thinking about analyzing or creating a software toolkit that faciltates these machine learning 
applications, but I am still unsure of what I specifically want to do.
