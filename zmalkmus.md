I am a first year Masters student with Dr. Taufer's GCLab. My research is in adaptive checkpointing for high performance computing and AI applications. I would be interested in utilizing metadata and asynchronous I/O to implement a smart program to restore checkpoints for our merkel tree checkpointing application. Questions that need answered are how to most efficiently read and write chunks over a large history of checkpoints.
