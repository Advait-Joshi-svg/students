My name is Mason Stott and I am a first (and only) year master's student in computer science. While I have some interest in machine learning, I am more interested in 3D software like simulations and, in particular, game development.
I have extensive experience in both of these fields in a research capacity, as I worked as a researcher at ORNL for 2 years developing VR simulators with ML elements. In this class, I would love to find an excuse to work in Unreal Engine or Unity
for the course project(s). I expect to have fun semester!
