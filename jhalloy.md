My name is Julian Halloy, and I am a first year masters student. I am interested in machine learning for my research. In this class, I hope to further my knowledge of software development techniques for my career. One idea I have for a topic in software engineering to review is to compare the different machine learning libraries available, such as TensorFlow and PyTorch.
