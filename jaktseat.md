Hello, I am a 1st year Master's student persuing a M.S. in computer science. I expect this to give me the oppurtinity to have a hands on role in the development and research of software and its applications.

I am not currently a part of any formal research, but I do have a large interest in using software to analyze real world subjects, such as image and word based analysis.
For this class, I would like to persue this sort of software engineering in my research paper reviews, and the class project. Though, I am open to exploring other subjects as well.

Currently, I do not have any more specific ideas of what to do for the class project.
