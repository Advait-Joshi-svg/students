Hello, My name is Malika Arifova and I am a senior undergraduate majoring in computer science and pre-med. My primary focus in computer science is cybersecurity and possibly medicine. 
I love spending time outdoor, arts & crafts, and gardening. 

I am open to explore different types of software engineering research topics. I am not in any research currently but I did some research on self- efficacy on K-12 graders through
engineering practices. I would like to do my project on cybersecurity or data science. I am thinking of researching different types of security and how effective they may be.
