## About Me
Please describe who you are, your research interests, and what you expect from the class and submit it as a file yournetid.md in a pull request to repo cs540-25/students
Specifically, tell what kind of software engineering research you want to review and what type of software development tool or research you'd like to work in your class project.

I am a second year Masters student interested in studying DL techniques to apply to QML. 
In this class, I would like to learn more about how to apply different types of RNNs, such as Mask RNNs, to various applications, especially in physics.
