I am a 4th year undergraduate doing the 5-year MSBS program here at UTK. I am interested in ML/AI, data analytics, and data visualization. I expect to learn more about how to structure complex software systems in a more modular and maintainable way and I want to learn about how to handle and process massive datasets and incorporate it with ML components.

I remember hearing about a paper that Apple released that talked about the reasoning capabilities of different LLMs and testing it with a new benchmark [("GSM-Symbolic: Understanding the Limitations of Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models")](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05229). I think it would be cool to write the literature review comparing the results from other papers with different benchmarks like GSM-Plus and GSM-IC to see how effective this GSM-Symbolic benchmark is.

I would like to make an application using different frameworks to test out which ones are easier to work with, which are harder, what required the most code written, least code written, and how fast I was able to complete the application.
