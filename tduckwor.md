# Who I Am
I'm a senior CS student in the 5-Year BS/MS program with a minor in Data Science. Currently, I work as a Project Intern at Agilaire, a local software development company that creates ambient air monitoring software for regulatory and research usage. In my free time I like to cook, bake bread, hike, and play with my two cats--Miso and Beans. 

# My Research Interests
I am not currently doing any CS research, but I am interested in data science, user experience, and cloud computing. 

# What I'd Like to Work On
For this class, I am interested in pretty much anything for the project, as I am still looking for a research area to work on for my Master's. A current idea that I have would be to create an application that simulates complex instruments to better help developers write and test code to communicate with them.
