Hi, my name is Mridula Venkatasamy and I am a first year masters student. I am taking this class to fulfill the degree requirement. Currently I work as a data developer for the men's basketball team within their performance analytics group and as an integration engineer for a supply chain software solutions startup. Also, I am currently researching under Dr.Santos and am looking into the intersection of object tracking & computer vision and performance analytics for the men's basketball team. 

It would be interesting to look into software development tools that provide ease of use when developing software (for example, how can people who don't have an in-depth technical background develop something like a full stack web app). In the past, I have worked with Flask and would like to gain more experience working with Flask. As of now, I'm not sure of the research I would like to work in for the class project.
