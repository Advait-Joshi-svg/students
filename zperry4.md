Hi! I'm Zac Perry. I am a current Master's student in computer science finishing up my last semester. Most of my past experience has been in software engineering, building backend systems. I'm not involved in any research at the moment but my primary interests are broadly in distributed systems, databases, and other data storage things (caches, storage engines, etc). More specifically, I really enjoy learning about different challenges in the field, such as replication, consistency, and consensus. In terms of databases, I just really enjoy learning more about their implementations and different tradeoffs / techniques used for building these systems. I'm hoping that through this class, I can continue to explore this field more and hopefully work on a project roughly related to one of these areas.
