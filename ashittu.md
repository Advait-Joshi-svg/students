About Me
I am a first-year student in the USER Lab, working with Dr. Ruoti. I completed my masters degree from Newcastle University under Professor Thomas Gross 

Research Interests:
My research interests lie in human-centered cybersecurity and privacy.

Expectations from the Class:
I expect to deepen my understanding of advanced software engineering techniques and gain practical experience in applying user-centered design principles to real-world problems, particularly in usability testing, user feedback integration, and collaborative development.


Software Engineering Research I Want to Review:
I would like to review research on the application of user-centered design in software engineering tools, with a focus on usability testing, user feedback integration, and collaborative development environments.


Software Development Tool or Research Area for Class Project:
For my class project, I propose conducting research on methods for automating the collection and analysis of user feedback to improve application usability. The focus will be on exploring existing approaches and tools that automate the process of gathering user insights—such as surveys, user behavior metrics, and session recordings—and evaluating their effectiveness.
