# About Me
I am currently in my last year in the computer science undergradate program at UTK and planning on pursuing a master's degree in computer science beginning in the Fall of 2025. My interests in computer science are more focused in the cybersecurity and cryptographic sectors. My Senio design project is centered around the use of blockchain in energy trading and developing an API/system to help facilitate the trading of energy between distributed energy resources. I dont have a specific tool/project however, I would prefer to not work on anything machine learning related.
